# Objective
Intelligent, carbon-based life is long gone, and only robots remain. Many of these robots are reaching the ends of their lifespan. Their hardware is failing. Iron rusts, wires corrode, and power is finite.

Junko is a repair robot.

Junko's primary objective is to repair other, broken, robots.
Some robots that Junko repairs will be enemies, while others will be friends.
